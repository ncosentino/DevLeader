This project demonstrates how to use `IOptionsMonitor<T>` in ASP.NET Core to access strongly-typed configuration that can be observed for changes at runtime. It shows the .NET Options pattern for binding JSON configuration sections to C# classes and injecting them into minimal API endpoints.

The application creates a minimal ASP.NET Core Web API with a single `GET /hello` endpoint that reads from a `SettingsOptions` class bound to the `Settings` section in `appsettings.json`. The `IOptionsMonitor<SettingsOptions>` is injected directly into the route handler, and its `CurrentValue` property provides real-time access to configuration values including `StringProperty` and `IntegerProperty`. Unlike `IOptions<T>`, `IOptionsMonitor<T>` supports live reloading of configuration changes without restarting the application, making it ideal for long-lived services and background tasks.

This is a focused educational example of Microsoft's recommended configuration management approach in modern .NET 8 applications.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- .NET 8.0 SDK or later
- An IDE such as Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or JetBrains Rider

### Running the Project
```bash
dotnet run --project OptionsMonitorExample
```
Then navigate to `https://localhost:<port>/hello` or use the included `.http` file to test the endpoint.
