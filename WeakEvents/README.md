Implementation of the weak event pattern in C# to prevent memory leaks caused by event subscriptions. Standard C# events create strong references from publisher to subscriber, preventing garbage collection even when subscribers are no longer needed. This project implements a WeakEvent<TEventArgs> class using WeakReference<T> and ConditionalWeakTable to hold event handlers without preventing garbage collection.

The implementation includes AddListener, RemoveListener, and Raise methods with a demo showing event source/listener lifecycle. Built on .NET 8 with no external dependencies, this is a focused example of how to break the strong reference chain between event publishers and subscribers to allow proper garbage collection.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- .NET 8.0 SDK
